Question 1

Given a string S, The task is to remove all the consecutive duplicate characters of the string and return the resultant string. 

Examples: 

Input: S= “aaaaabbbbbb”
Output: ab


Input: S = “geeksforgeeks”
Output: geksforgeks

Input: S = “aabccba”
Output: abcba


Question 2
Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

For example, the square matrix arr is shown below:

1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9  

The left-to-right diagonal = 1+ 5 + 9 = 15.
.The right to left diagonal =  3 +5 +9 = 17 . Their absolute difference is
|15-17| = 2 .
.

Function description

Complete the diagonal difference function in the editor below.

diagonalDifference takes the following parameter:

    int arr[n][m]: an array of integers

Return

    int: the absolute diagonal difference

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, n, the number of rows and columns in the square matrix  arr .
Each of the next n lines describes a row, arr[i] , and consists of n space-separated integers arr[i][j]

.Constraints

-100 <= a[i][j]  <= 100

Output Format

Return the absolute difference between the sums of the matrix's two diagonals as a single integer.



Question 3

Julius Caesar protected his confidential information by encrypting it using a cipher. Caesar's cipher shifts each letter by a number of letters. If the shift takes you past the end of the alphabet, just rotate back to the front of the alphabet. In the case of a rotation by 3, w, x, y and z would map to z, a, b and c.
Original alphabet:      abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
Alphabet rotated +3:  defghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabc
Example
There’s-a-starman
k=3
The alphabet is rotated by  3, matching the mapping above. The encrypted string is

Wkhuh’v-d-vwdupdq
Input:
s=There’s-a-starman
k=3
Output:
Wkhuh’v-d-vwdupdq
